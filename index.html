<p>According to Wikipedia, Node.js is "an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications." It was initially released on May 27, 2009. It is
written in the languages of C, C++, and Javascript. It can be run on OS X, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Microsoft Windows, and webOS. As will be discussed in further detail below, 
node.js, also quoted from Wikipedia, "provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability. 
These technologies are commonly used for real-time web applications." To go along with that, node.js uses the Google V8 Javascript engine for coding. 
Groupon, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Walmart, and GoDaddy are just a few examples of its use.</p>

<p>This brings up the question, What really is node.js? Sure, it sounds fancy and relatively new, but what does it do, and what are its advantages?
Well, first off it incorporates web development in a dynamic language that runs on a VM that is fast. Second, it can handle a lot of concurrent connections.
Third, it is great for creating event loops. Fourth, it is used with Javascript, which is already really popular among programmers. Lastly, it can be used
on a web server, which eases communication.</p>
